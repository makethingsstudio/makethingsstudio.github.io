# Design Progress on Make Things

Following up on the work that I started yesterday, today I got down a a basic design direction for the homepage. 

In looking at other websites, I really liked what [Whiteboard](http://whiteboard.is) was doing with their homepage. I may have used their concept a little too closely, but for right now I am okay with that. 

I was able to mockup sections for the clients that I work with, select clients and recent work. The whole process took a bit longer than I would have liked (about 4 hours), but overall I think it's moving in a good direction.
