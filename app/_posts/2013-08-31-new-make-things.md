# Making a new Make Things

Today (8/31/2013) at 1:30, I sat down to create a new website for Make Things 
Studio, the independent design consultancy I run. The Make Things website

Finished writing my goals for the website by 4:00pm. These were more business 
oriented goals. Next, I plan on highlighting some of the technical goals I 
have with the site.

Did some laundry and then used [Yeoman](#) to setup a jekyll site.
